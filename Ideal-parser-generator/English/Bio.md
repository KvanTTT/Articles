I am a Software Engineering graduate from Bauman Moscow State Technical
University in 2011 (Bachelor\'s) and 2013 (Master\'s). Parsing and
compilers have interested me since my student days.

While working at a web photo service in 2013, I developed a method for
compiling the same C\# code for both .NET and JavaScript. This inspired
me to write an article: [Universal C\# Code for .NET and
JavaScript](https://github.com/KvanTTT/Articles/blob/master/Universal-CSharp-Code-for-NET-and-JavaScript/English.md).

In June 2015, I joined Positive Technologies, where I began working on
implementation of a universal signature-based analyzer for code in
different languages (C\#, Java, PHP, PL/SQL, T-SQL, and JavaScript). The
ANTLR parser generator was the logical choice based on its superior
features and community at that point in time. Open-source PHP and T-SQL
grammars were made, as well as major improvements to grammars for
JavaScript, Java8, PL/SQL, Objective-C, and C\#. These grammars are
currently used in open-source and commercial products. The analyzer code is available
online: [PT.PM](https://github.com/PositiveTechnologies/PT.PM). In addition to my
primary work, I have written a few articles on related topics:

* [Theory and Practice of Source Code Parsing with ANTLR and Roslyn](https://github.com/PositiveTechnologies/PT.Doc/blob/master/Articles/Theory-and-Practice-of-source-code-parsing-with-ANTLR-and-Roslyn/English.md)
* [Tree structures processing and unified AST](https://github.com/PositiveTechnologies/PT.Doc/blob/master/Articles/Tree-structures-processing-and-unified-AST/English.md)
* [Pattern language for a universal signature-based code analyzer](https://github.com/PositiveTechnologies/PT.Doc/blob/master/Articles/Pattern-language-for-a-universal-signature-based-code-analyzer/English.md)

In 2017, I started work on a new module for analyzing interprocedural data flows.

Since November 2016, I have been working at Swiftify, a startup for
converting Objective-C code to Swift. There I have implemented support
for preprocessing directives, improved the code base, and achieved
significant performance gains in the parser and converter
(article: [Parsing Preprocessor Directives in
Objective-C](https://github.com/KvanTTT/Articles/blob/master/Parsing-Preprocessor-Directives-in-Objective-C-Code/English.md)).

I am a maintainer for
the [grammars-v4](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/) grammar
repository (where I have made over [30 pull
requests](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Akvanttt)).
I have also contributed improvements to the ANTLR parser generator
itself (more than [20 pull
requests](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Akvanttt)).

Besides parsers and compilers, I have experience in image and audio
processing, as well as web and desktop programming.
